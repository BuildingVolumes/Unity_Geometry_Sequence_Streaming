> 👉🏻 This is just a quick summary of the conversion process, more details can be [found here](docs/tutorials/prepare-data/)

## Conversion

1. Ensure that in your input sequence, each frame file is numbered in an ascending order

2. Almost all commonly used pointcloud/mesh (.fbx .obj .gltf .ply .xzy) and image (.dds .jpeg .png .tga) formats can be used as source material. Ensure that your sequence is in such a format

3. Download the converter binaries for windows here.

4. Open the converter, and set the **input folder** to the folder containing your sequence. The **output folder** should be set to a different (empty) folder. Click on **Start Conversion**.

## Playback in Unity

1. Open your project and scene in Unity.

2. Add a **GeometrySequencePlayer** component to any gameobject.

3. Click on **Open Sequence** and open the folder with the converted sequence (the output folder).

4. Click on Play in Unity. Your scene should now start with the playback/streaming.
